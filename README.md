# BLSSignature
FileSplitter takes a file and outputs many files with appended numbers 1->n

FileSigner signs or verifies sets of files that follow the above scheme

Signer does the actual signing/verifying

I still need to put together a class or something to handle the initialization stuff for the parameters, etc.
