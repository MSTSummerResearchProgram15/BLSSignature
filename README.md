# BLSSignature
FileSplitter takes a file and outputs many files with appended numbers 1->n

FileSigner signs or verifies sets of files that follow the above scheme

Signer does the actual signing/verifying

BLSSignature handles parameters and keys

Still need a generator for the curve properties file

Optimization possible
